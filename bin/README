Check the Photo class. it has extended observable. The FlaggedAlbum and GreatAlbum classes are subclasses of the abstract class
SearchAlbum, which implements observer. SearchAlbum and Album both implement the AlbumInterface.

When a changed in a photo has occured, the setters in the photo class notify the observers for the photos. Then the notify method is ran 
in search Album from either the flagged Album or great Album's update method, updating the photo's state.
